basic starting file structure for Umass Dartmouth

This project was an extreme struggle for me. I have learned so much while creating my portfolio website.
I did not get to do nearly as much as I planned or wanted to do due to time, skillset, and fixing bugs.
I am satisfied with the overall look which I think I have refined. I intend to work on this more after this semester to make it practical and easy to navigate.
The design choices I made were mostly subconscious choices. I chose colors I thought looked nice with my background. I discovered through this project I gravitate towards this grey color scheme.
My website reflects my style which is apparent in my other work.
My type choices were meant to be easily read, as well as reflect my contemporary style. It was important for me to keep both of those aspects on my website.
The background was somewhat an afterthought, while messing around with photos to use as a background, a pattern I made last year seemed to fit nicely.
I made a few edits to the original final and it became the perfect non-distracting yet just interesting enough background.
I attempted to make my code as dry as possible. I struggled a lot with this because I was setting up my files incorrectly initally.
It was hard to correct everything without breaking my code but I have somewhat managed to do so while drying up my code some.
I tried to sort everything into their own CSS and HTML files. Ex. The about page HTML file has the main.css linked to it. 
The other two pages followed suit, but I only kept the essential parts that actually effected and applied to those pages. So my css files are short.
I was able to include a few things that show myself beyond my art including a spotify playlist (which I could not resize, I tried everything). I also linked my instagram page.
Some stretch goals of mine were to include a NAV bar, I could not do so in the interest of time. I chose to fix bugs and refine rather than try to add a new element.
I let it slide however because I only have 3 total pages. I also wish I was able to do an animation to my photo of myself but I could not get css animations to cooperate.
So now the image remains still, which I am okay with.
One thing I am really proud of doing is figuring out how to get rid of styling for links. I was able to keep an underline on hover so you can tell it is a link to click on.
It no longer looks blue/purple. 

I have again learned so much taking this class and completing this project. I will not let what I could not accoplish defeat me. I understand coding is hard.
I am proud of what I have been able to do and produce. I made every final choice with a purpose. I hope as I learn more to update this site.
