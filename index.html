            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Sarah and I am a graphic designer from Cape Cod. I am currently a sophomore at the University of Massachusetts 
                Dartmouth. I started to gain interest in digital artwork when I purchased my first wacom tablet back in 2014. I loved the 
                endless possibilities that came from creating art on my computer, and that is what ultimately made me want to pursue graphic 
                design. I enjoy creating cute characters and illustrations just as much as I enjoy creating intelligence and refined graphics. 
                I care about many things outside of graphic design such at the environment and social justice, and I try to incorporate these 
                outside interest into my work as much as I can. I hope to promote change for the benefit of the world through the content I 
                create with my BFA.
