            My name is Sarah and I am a graphic designer from Cape Cod. I am currently a sophomore at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth. I started to gain interest in digital artwork when I purchased my first wacom tablet back in 2014. I loved the endless possibilities that came from creating art on my computer, and that is what ultimately made me want to pursue graphic design. I enjoy creating cute characters and illustrations just as much as I enjoy creating intelligence and refined graphics. I care about many things outside of graphic design such at the environment and social justice, and I try to incorporate these outside interest into my work as much as I can. I hope to promote change for the benefit of the world through the content I create with my BFA.
